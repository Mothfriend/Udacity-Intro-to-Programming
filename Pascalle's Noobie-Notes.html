    <h3>Intro to the World Wide Web</h3>
      <h4>The Basics of the Web</h4>
        <p><span>The main type of document on the web is HTML. Different types of files also exist on the web as plain text, HTML, images, videos, and audio.</span></p>
      <h4>The main components of the Web are:</h4>
        <ul><em>
          <li>a browser: application that interprets files exchanged between servers and devices</li>
          <li>internet: network of computers all linked together so they can exchange files</li>
          <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer protocol is a mechanism used for communitcation between browsers and servers</li>
          <li>servers: computers that host files to be accessed by a browser</li>
        </em></ul>

    <h3>Basics of HTML</h3>
      <p><b><span>HyperText Markup Language</span></b></span> is a document written in language recognized by browsers.
      HTML <b><span>elements</span></b> consist of opening and closing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">tags</a> that wrap the content of a webpage within the document. These tags instruct a web browser to display content a certain way on a web page.
      Some elements can have <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp">attributes</a> assigned to them to manipulate how the content behaves. Example: "href" is an attribute that defines a URL to a link.</p>
      <p>In these notes, elements are used to create bold headers and subheaders, define paragraphs, and source image content.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">Container</a> elements create a box around the content. Usually <b><span>block</span></b> elements are coded at the beginning of a new line in the text editor.
      <b><span>Inline</span></b>, however, are container elements written within the a line of code to isolate parts of content within the same line in an editor.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp">Span</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">Div</a> are two examples of inline and block elements. Span, being inline, will control how isolated text within a line displays or behaves. Div, blocks out content for the purpose of applying layout styles to a section that's been blocked out.</p>
